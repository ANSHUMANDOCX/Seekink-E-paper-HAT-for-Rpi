## **DAY 3- Starting OUT**

there are no epaper hat that exist for the epaper displays made by seekink. These are cheap but there are no peripherals to use with it. so i want to make one to use with a raspberry pi

started out by reading datasheets for the seekink display and figuring out the circuit and the component

time spent- 2hr
